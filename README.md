A digital signature is a reliable electronic method of signing electronic documents
that provides the recipient with a way to verify the sender, determine that the
content of the document has not been altered since it was signed and prevent the
sender from repudiating the fact that he or she signed and sent the electronic
document.

This thesis mainly discusses the El-Gamal signature scheme, especially on the forgery 
of this signature scheme and its variations. There are some ways to forge an El-Gamal signature, 
without knowing the private key of the signer, if the parameters used in the signature scheme are 
not carefully chosen. One of this forgery is done by the Bleiclienbacher's attack.
